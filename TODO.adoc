= TODO

- Height resolver
- Better layout errors handling
- 'width' should always refer to content width, border calculations should be done in printer, not earlier (additional property on table 'overallWidth' for width with borders)
- HTML printer
- Border type should be typed in builder (not just Border)
- Spanned cells (just split content to given cell ids)
- Rounded corners, dotted & dashed lines (round corners should be property of style, not styleSet; current algorithm demands generation of thousands of definitions, but in fact it is possible to use styles: eg. for all light lines - letter L, for all heavy lines - letter H, for all double lines - letter D - it is enough as there is anyway not enough intersections in box characters, so for some line styles intersection have to be reused; e.g. LLLL=┼ while horizontal L might be e.g.: '─', '┈', '┄', '╌')
