= TODO

- Height resolver
- Better layout errors handling
- 'width' should always refer to content width, border calculations should be done in printer, not earlier (additional property on table 'overallWidth' for width with borders)
- HTML printer
- Border type should be typed in builder (not just Border)
- Spanned cells (just split content to given cell ids)
- Rounded corners, dotted & dashed lines
- Simplification of col syncing: syncColumns() - automatically applies same width to all columns
